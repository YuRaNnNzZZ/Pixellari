# Pixellari Cyrillic
[![License: Open Font-1.1](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-OFL%201.1-lightgreen.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/OFL-1.1)

A simple pixel font that's 100% free to use, now with Cyrillic characters support. The only thing I ask for is credit for me and the original author, if possible.

Created on 2017-01-07 using the awesome free font-making tool, [BitFontMaker 2](http://www.pentacom.jp/pentacom/bitfontmaker2/).

Edited on 2021-03-13 using the same tool to add Cyrillic characters as I didn't want to see default Roboto font fallback in the game I anticipated.

If you're looking to download the original font, please consider downloading from [Dafont][font-link] if possible, as it makes it more popular on the website. :)
